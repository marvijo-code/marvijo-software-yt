# Create a professional html file with a table to compare the API pricing (per million tokens) of the following LLMs:

- Gemini 2 Pro
- Gemini 2 Flash
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- GPT-4o
- OpenAI o3-mini
- OpenAI o1
- DeepSeek R1
- DeepSeek V3
- Qwen 2.5 Max
- Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B

## Add the standing/position and percentage/rating of the LLMs in the table from the following sources:
### https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/
### https://livebench.ai/

- ONLY USE DATA FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES
- a web search isn't sufficient, you need to scrape the data from the official source URLs after you have the URLs from the web search
- Make sure you search the internet for the latest pricing and data.
- Do not add sample data to the table.
- Do not add any other text to the table.
- Just the table.
- Make sure that the data is correct
- if you store any data, store it in a simple json file
- only store data you need in llm_data.json
- make sure you use the right naming for the llms, e.g., "Deepseek R1" is different to "Deepseek V3" and it's not generally "Deepseek"
- make sure you use the right pricing for the llms, e.g., "Deepseek R1" is different to "Deepseek V3" and it's not generally "Deepseek"
- make sure the html table looks professional and is easy to read
- use alternate colors for the rows
- add a Total Price column to the table that sums up the input and output prices of the llms
- order the table by the Total Price column
- add a column with a link to the pricing page of each llm
